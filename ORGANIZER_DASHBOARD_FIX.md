# ✅ ORGANIZER DASHBOARD - CREATE EVENT FIXED

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The **simple create event form** in the Organizer Dashboard has been fixed!

### Location:
- File: `frontend_tkinter/pages/organizer_dashboard.py`
- Function: `submit_event()` inside `_render_create_event()`

---

## 🐛 The Same Problems (Now Fixed)

### 1. Missing `organizerId` ✅
**Before:** Not sent to backend  
**After:** Gets from session: `user_data['id']`

### 2. Wrong field names ✅
**Before:** `start_time`, `end_time` (snake_case)  
**After:** `startTime`, `endTime` (camelCase)

### 3. Wrong datetime format ✅
**Before:** Space separator: `2025-10-20 09:00:00`  
**After:** ISO 8601 with T: `2025-10-20T09:00:00`

---

## 📝 How to Use the Form

### 1. Login as Organizer
```
Email: organizer1@campus.com
Password: test123
```

### 2. Fill the Form

You'll see these fields:

| Field | Example | Format |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Event Title** | Tech Workshop | Any text (3-255 chars) |
| **Description** | Learn AI basics... | Any text (10+ chars) |
| **Start Time** | `2025-10-20 09:00:00` | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| **End Time** | `2025-10-20 17:00:00` | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| **Venue** | Main Auditorium | Any text |
| **Capacity** | 50 | Optional (not sent to backend) |

**Note:** The form accepts space format, but the code converts it to ISO 8601 automatically!

### 3. Click "Create Event"

You should see:
```
✅ Event 'Tech Workshop' created successfully!
```

---

## 🎨 UI Improvements

- Added **default placeholder values** in time fields
- Example: `2025-10-20 09:00:00` and `2025-10-20 17:00:00`
- Makes it easier to see the expected format

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Capacity Field
The form has a "Capacity" field, but **it's NOT sent to the backend** because `CreateEventRequest.java` doesn't support it.

To add capacity support, you need to:
1. Update `CreateEventRequest.java`
2. Update `Event.java` model
3. Update database schema

### Date Format
- **User types:** `2025-10-20 09:00:00` (with space)
- **Backend receives:** `2025-10-20T09:00:00` (with T)
- Conversion happens automatically ✅
