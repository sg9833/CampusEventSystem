# Resource Booking Implementation - Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
The resource booking functionality has been **fully implemented** and is now active in the Campus Event System.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Student Dashboard - Book Resources Button
**File:** `frontend_tkinter/pages/student_dashboard.py`

**Before:**
- Clicking "Book Resources" showed: "Resource booking UI not implemented yet."

**After:**
- Clicking "Book Resources" now navigates to the Browse Resources page where users can view and book resources

**Code Change:**
```python
def _render_book_resources(self):
    """Navigate to browse resources page with booking functionality"""
    self.controller.show_frame('BrowseResourcesPage')
```

### 2. Browse Resources - Book Now Button
**File:** `frontend_tkinter/pages/browse_resources.py`

**Before:**
- Clicking "Book Now" showed a message: "Booking form would open here"

**After:**
- Clicking "Book Now" opens a modal window with the full booking interface
- The resource is pre-selected for booking
- Users can immediately select date/time and complete the booking

**Code Change:**
```python
def _book_resource(self, resource):
    """Book a resource - open booking page with preselected resource"""
    resource_id = resource.get('id')
    if resource_id:
        from pages.book_resource import BookResourcePage
        
        # Create modal window for booking
        booking_modal = tk.Toplevel(self)
        booking_modal.title(f"Book {resource.get('name', 'Resource')}")
        booking_modal.geometry('900x800')
        # ... modal setup code ...
        
        # Create booking page in modal with preselected resource
        booking_page = BookResourcePage(booking_modal, self.controller, resource_id=resource_id)
