# ✅ QUICK LOGIN GUIDE - Campus Event System

## 🎯 Two Issues Fixed!

### Fix #1: Role Validation ✅
- **Problem:** Backend expected lowercase role (`student`, `organizer`)
- **Solution:** Frontend now converts role to lowercase before sending
- **Status:** FIXED ✅

### Fix #2: Login with Email (not Username) ✅
- **Problem:** Login form said "Username" but backend only accepts EMAIL
- **Solution:** Changed label to "Email" and updated documentation
- **Status:** FIXED ✅

## 🔍 WHY THESE CHANGES?

### Backend Design:
The backend currently only supports:
- **User fields:** id, name, **email**, passwordHash, role, createdAt
- **Login:** Only by **EMAIL** (not username)
- **Registration:** Only stores name, email, password, role

### Fields NOT Stored by Backend:
These are collected in registration but currently ignored:
- ❌ Username
- ❌ Phone number
- ❌ Department/College

*Future enhancement: Add backend support for these fields*
