# üîç DELETE EVENT DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS

**Backend Status:** ‚úÖ Running with debug logging (PID: 86736)  
**Frontend Status:** ‚úÖ Running (PID: 86792)

## Steps to Debug Delete Issue:

### 1. Try to Delete an Event
1. Login as **organizer1@campus.com** / **test123**
2. Go to **"My Events"** tab
3. Select an event you created (should have organizerId: 2)
4. Click the **"Delete"** button
5. Confirm the deletion

### 2. After You Get the Error, Tell Me
Once you see the "You do not have permission" error, **tell me** and I'll check the backend logs to see:
- What user ID was extracted from the JWT token
- What the event's organizerId is
- Why the permission check is failing

### 3. What I'm Looking For in Logs
The debug logs will show:
```
DELETE request for event ID: X
User from JWT - ID: Y, Email: organizer1@campus.com, Role: ORGANIZER
Event found - ID: X, Title: ..., OrganizerId: Z
```

This will help me see if:
- ‚úÖ User ID from JWT matches what's in the database (should be 2)
- ‚úÖ Event organizerId matches user ID
- ‚ùå If there's a mismatch causing the permission denial

## Possible Issues We're Checking:

1. **JWT Token Issue:** User ID not being extracted correctly from token
2. **Database Mismatch:** Event organizerId doesn't match user ID in session
3. **Type Mismatch:** Integer comparison issue between user.getId() and event.getOrganizerId()
4. **Null Values:** User object is null or has null ID

## Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Try to delete an event now
2. ‚úÖ Get the error message
3. ‚úÖ Tell me it happened
4. ‚è≥ I'll read the backend logs and fix the exact issue

---

**Ready when you are!** Just try the delete operation and let me know when you see the error.
