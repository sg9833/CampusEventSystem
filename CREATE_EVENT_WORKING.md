# 🎉 CREATE EVENT - NOW WORKING!

## ✅ Problem SOLVED

The **403 Forbidden** error when creating events has been **FIXED**!

---

## 🚀 Quick Test

Want to verify it works? Run this:

```bash
cd /Users/garinesaiajay/Desktop/CampusEventSystem
python3.11 test_create_event.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ TEST PASSED - Create Event is working!
```

---

## 📝 What Was Wrong?

### The Issues:
1. ❌ **Missing `organizerId`** - Backend required it, frontend didn't send it
2. ❌ **Wrong field names** - Used `start_time` instead of `startTime`
3. ❌ **Wrong datetime format** - Used space instead of 'T' separator

### The Fixes:
1. ✅ Added `organizerId` from user session
2. ✅ Changed to camelCase (`startTime`, `endTime`)
3. ✅ Fixed datetime format: `2025-10-20T09:00:00`

## 🎯 How to Create an Event Now

### Option 1: Use the GUI (Recommended)

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

2. **Login as Organizer:**
   - Email: `organizer1@campus.com`
   - Password: `test123`

3. **Create Event:**
   - Click "My Events" in sidebar
   - Click "➕ Create New Event"
   - Fill in the form:
     * **Event Name:** My Awesome Event
     * **Description:** (at least 10 characters)
     * **Date:** 2025-10-20 (future date)
     * **Start Time:** 09:00
     * **End Time:** 17:00
     * **Venue:** Main Auditorium
   - Click "Next" → "Next" → "Submit for Approval"

4. **Success!** You should see:
   ```
   ✅ Event submitted successfully!
   Your event is now pending admin approval.
   ```

### Option 2: Test via API

```bash
python3.11 test_create_event.py
```

## 📦 What's Required for Creating Events?

The backend (`CreateEventRequest.java`) needs exactly these fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Format | Example |
|-------|------|----------|--------|---------|
| `title` | String | ✅ Yes | 3-255 chars | "Tech Workshop" |
| `description` | String | ✅ Yes | 10-5000 chars | "Learn about AI..." |
| `organizerId` | Integer | ✅ Yes | Positive number | 2 |
| `startTime` | DateTime | ✅ Yes | ISO 8601 | "2025-10-20T09:00:00" |
| `endTime` | DateTime | ✅ Yes | ISO 8601 | "2025-10-20T17:00:00" |
| `venue` | String | ✅ Yes | Max 255 chars | "Main Auditorium" |

**Important:** 
- End time must be AFTER start time
- Date must be in the FUTURE
- OrganizerId must match your logged-in user ID

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "User session not found"
**Fix:** Log out and log back in

### "Event date must be in the future"
**Fix:** Use a future date (e.g., tomorrow or next week)

### "End time must be after start time"
**Fix:** Make sure end time is later than start time

### Still getting 403?
**Fix:** Make sure you're logged in as an organizer:
```
Email: organizer1@campus.com
Password: test123
```

### Backend not running?
**Fix:**
```bash
./stop.sh
./run.sh
```
