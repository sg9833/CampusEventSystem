## 🎯 What Client Will Do

**The client handles ALL cleanup and configuration:**

### Step 1: Cleanup (10-15 min)
Client reads `CLEANUP_BEFORE_SETUP.md` and:
- Deletes test scripts (`test_*.py`, `test_*.sh`, `test_*.bat`)
- Deletes `CREDENTIALS_QUICK_REF.txt` (your hardcoded paths)
- Deletes log files (`*.log`)
- Deletes build artifacts (`target/`, `__pycache__/`)
- Deletes OS files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)

### Step 2: Configuration (5 min)
Client edits `application.properties` and:
- Changes: `spring.datasource.password=SAIAJAY@2005`
- To: `spring.datasource.password=THEIR_MYSQL_PASSWORD`

### Step 3: Setup (60-75 min)
Client follows `CLIENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`:
- Installs Java 17, Maven 3.8+, Python 3.11+, MySQL 8.0
- Creates database: `campusdb`
- Loads schema: `schema.sql`
- Loads sample data: `sample_data.sql`
- Runs application: `./run.sh`
- Tests with demo accounts
