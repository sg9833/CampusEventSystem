---

## Integration Points

### ‚úÖ Already Integrated

1. **Event Registration** (`pages/event_details_modal.py`)
   - Line: ~440-455
   - Sends confirmation email after successful registration

2. **Event Approvals** (`pages/event_approvals.py`)
   - Lines: ~480-495 (approval), ~570-585 (rejection)
   - Sends approval/rejection notification to organizer

3. **Booking Approvals** (`pages/booking_approvals.py`)
   - Lines: ~680-695 (approval), ~730-745 (rejection)
   - Sends confirmation/rejection notification to user

### üîÑ To Be Implemented

4. **Event Reminders** (Scheduled Job)
   - Create a background service to check events happening tomorrow
   - Send reminders to all registered users

5. **Weekly Digest** (Scheduled Job)
   - Run every Monday morning
   - Send upcoming events to all active users

6. **Booking Creation** (`pages/book_resource.py`)
   - Send booking request confirmation after submission

---

## Email Templates

All email templates are generated server-side in `NotificationController.java`:

- `generateEventRegistrationEmail()` - Event registration confirmation
- `generateEventReminderEmail()` - Event reminder (1 day before)
- `generateBookingConfirmationEmail()` - Booking approved/rejected
- `generateApprovalNotificationEmail()` - Event/booking approval/rejection
- `generateWeeklyDigestEmail()` - Weekly upcoming events

---

## Configuration

### Backend (Production)

To use real email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.), update `NotificationController.java`:

```java
// Add email service dependency (e.g., SendGrid)
@Autowired
private EmailSender emailSender;

// In sendEmail() method, replace:
System.out.println("EMAIL NOTIFICATION...");

// With:
emailSender.send(to, subject, body);
```

### Frontend

Email service uses existing `APIClient` and `SessionManager`:
- No additional configuration needed
- Automatically gets user info from session
- Sends emails asynchronously (non-blocking)

---

## Testing

### Test Email Sending

```python
from utils.email_service import get_email_service

email_service = get_email_service()

# Test event registration email
email_service.send_event_registration_confirmation(
    user_email="test@example.com",
    event_details={
        "title": "Test Event",
        "date": "2025-10-15",
        "time": "14:00",
        "location": "Test Room"
    }
)

# Check backend console for email output
```

### Check Email Logs

```bash
# Backend console will show:
========================================
EMAIL NOTIFICATION
========================================
To: test@example.com
Subject: Registration Confirmed: Test Event
Type: event_registration
----------------------------------------
Dear Student,

You have successfully registered for the following event:

Event: Test Event
Date: October 15, 2025
Time: 2:00 PM
Location: Test Room
...
========================================
```

---

## Error Handling

### Email Service Errors

All email errors are caught and logged but **do not block** the main operation:

```python
try:
    email_service.send_event_reminder(...)
except Exception as email_error:
    print(f"[EMAIL ERROR] Failed to send: {email_error}")
    # User's event registration still succeeds
```

### API Errors

Backend returns proper error messages:

```json
{
  "error": "Recipient email is required"
}
```

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scheduled Reminders**
   - Implement background job to send event reminders
   - Use APScheduler or Celery

2. **Email Preferences**
   - Allow users to opt-in/opt-out of email types
   - Store preferences in database

3. **Rich HTML Emails**
   - Add styled HTML templates
   - Include campus logo and branding

4. **Email Analytics**
   - Track open rates and click rates
   - Store in `email_notifications` table

5. **Attachment Support**
   - Send calendar invites (.ics files)
   - Attach event posters

---

## Database Schema (Optional)

For email history tracking:

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_notifications (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    recipient_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(500),
    body TEXT,
    type VARCHAR(50),
    sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'sent',
    INDEX idx_recipient (recipient_email),
    INDEX idx_sent_at (sent_at)
);
```
