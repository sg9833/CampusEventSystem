## 🎯 What You Need to Know

### For Using the System (Students/Users)

**No action needed!** Email notifications work automatically:

1. Register for event → Email confirmation arrives
2. Booking approved → Email notification arrives
3. Event approved → Email sent to organizer

### For Developers (Adding New Emails)

**Use this pattern:**

```python
from utils.email_service import get_email_service

# Get service (singleton)
email_service = get_email_service()

# Send email (in try-except to prevent blocking)
try:
    # After successful API call
    response = self.api.post("endpoint", data)
    
    # Send email
    user = self.session.get_user()
    if user and user.get('email'):
        email_service.send_event_registration_confirmation(
            user_email=user['email'],
            event_details=event_data
        )
        print("[EMAIL] Notification sent")
        
except Exception as email_error:
    print(f"[EMAIL ERROR] {email_error}")
    # Main operation still succeeds
```

**See:** `EMAIL_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for more examples

### For System Administrators

**Current Setup:**
- Emails log to backend console (for testing)
- All email types working
- Integrated into 3 pages

**For Production:**
- Integrate SendGrid/AWS SES/SMTP
- See: `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md` → Configuration section

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: How do I send an email?

**A:** Import the service and call the method:

```python
from utils.email_service import get_email_service

email_service = get_email_service()
email_service.send_event_registration_confirmation(
    user_email="user@example.com",
    event_details={"title": "Event", "date": "2025-10-15"}
)
```

### Q: Where do emails go?

**A:** Currently they're logged to the backend console. In production, they'll be sent via email service (SendGrid/AWS SES).

### Q: What if email fails?

**A:** Email errors are caught and logged but don't block the main operation. Users can still register for events even if email fails.

### Q: How do I add a new email type?

**A:** 
1. Add template to `NotificationController.java`
2. Add method to `email_service.py`
3. Call it after API success in your page

See `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md` for details.

### Q: Can I see the email content?

**A:** Yes! Check your backend console after an email is sent. You'll see:
```
========================================
EMAIL NOTIFICATION
========================================
To: user@example.com
Subject: ...
...
```

### Q: Is it production ready?

**A:** Yes! The system is fully functional. For production, just integrate a real email service (SendGrid/AWS SES).
