### 2. Organizer Dashboard (`frontend_tkinter/pages/organizer_dashboard.py`)
- ‚úÖ **Added** "Book Resources" button to sidebar navigation (new feature for organizers)
- ‚úÖ **Added** "My Bookings" button to sidebar navigation (organizers can view their resource bookings)

  - "Book Now" buttons are replaced with info messages: "Booking available for organizers"
  - Subtitle updated to: "View available campus resources (booking available for organizers)"
  
- **For Organizers/Admins:**
  - Full booking functionality remains intact
  - All "Book Now" buttons work normally
  - Subtitle: "Find and book campus resources for your events"

## User Experience

### Students
- **Dashboard:** No "Book Resources" or "My Bookings" buttons in sidebar
- **Browse Resources page:** 
  - They see all resources with full details
  - They can check availability calendars
  - Instead of "Book Now" buttons, they see: 
    - In resource cards: "Booking available for organizers" (gray text)
    - In detail modal: Yellow info banner stating "üìã Resource booking is available for event organizers"

### Organizers
- **Dashboard:** New "Book Resources" and "My Bookings" buttons in sidebar
- **Browse Resources page:**
  - They see all resources with full details
  - They can check availability calendars
  - They have full access to "Book Now" buttons
  - They can complete resource booking for their events
- **My Bookings page:** Can view all their resource bookings with status and details

## Rationale
This change ensures that:
1. Only event organizers who are planning events can book campus resources
2. Resource allocation is better managed and tied to event planning
3. Students can still view resource availability for informational purposes
4. The system maintains clear separation of user roles and permissions
