# ✅ Test Credentials - FIXED AND WORKING

## Problem Solved

The password hashes in the database for `organizer1@campus.com`, `student1@campus.com`, and `admin@campus.com` were incorrect. They have now been updated to match the correct BCrypt hash for password: **`test123`**

## 🎯 Working Test Accounts

All three accounts are now **confirmed working**:

### 1. 🎭 Organizer Account

### 2. 👨‍🎓 Student Account
