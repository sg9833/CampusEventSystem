# Login Field Fix - Email vs Username

## 🐛 Issue
After registering successfully and logging out, users tried to login with their **username** (e.g., `johnsmith`) but received an error:

```
Login failed:
HTTP error: 400 - {
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "email": "Email must be a valid email address"
  },
  "status": "error",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T09:35:09.659653"
}
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

**Backend-Frontend Mismatch:**

### Backend Behavior:
- **User Model** only has: `id`, `name`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `role`, `createdAt`
- **NO `username` field exists in the database**
- **RegisterRequest DTO** only accepts: `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
- **LoginRequest DTO** only accepts: `email`, `password`
- Login endpoint (`POST /auth/login`) looks up users by **email only**

### Frontend Behavior:
- **Registration form** collects: `fullname`, `email`, `phone`, `username`, `password`, `department`, `role`
- **Login page** label said "Username" but sent the value as `email` field
- Users naturally tried to use their "username" to login
- But backend rejected it because it expected a valid email format

### Extra Fields Being Collected:
These fields are collected in the registration form but **ignored by the backend**:
- ❌ `username` - not stored anywhere
- ❌ `phone` - not stored anywhere
- ❌ `department` - not stored anywhere

## ✅ Solution

Changed the login form label from **"Username"** to **"Email"** to match backend expectations.

### Code Change

**File:** `frontend_tkinter/pages/login_page.py`

**Line:** ~108

```python
# Before
self.username_label = tk.Label(
    self.lgn_frame,
    text="Username",  # ← Misleading label
    bg="#040405",
    fg="#4f4e4d",
    font=("yu gothic ui", 13, "bold")
)

# After
self.username_label = tk.Label(
    self.lgn_frame,
    text="Email",  # ← Now clear it expects email
    bg="#040405",
    fg="#4f4e4d",
    font=("yu gothic ui", 13, "bold")
)
```

## 📝 Updated Test Data

### ✅ Correct Login Credentials

**Test User 1 (Student):**
- **Email:** `john.smith@university.edu`
- **Password:** `Test@1234`

**Test User 2 (Organizer):**
- **Email:** `jane.doe@university.edu`
- **Password:** `Secure@2024`

### ⚠️ What NOT to Use for Login:
- ❌ Username: `johnsmith` - This won't work!
- ❌ Username: `janedoe` - This won't work!

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before Fix:
1. User registers with email `john.smith@university.edu` and username `johnsmith`
2. User logs out
3. User sees "Username" field on login page
4. User enters `johnsmith` (the username they just created)
5. ❌ **Error:** "Email must be a valid email address"
6. User confused why their username doesn't work

### After Fix:
1. User registers with email `john.smith@university.edu`
2. User logs out
3. User sees "Email" field on login page (clear expectation!)
4. User enters `john.smith@university.edu`
5. ✅ **Success:** Login works correctly

## 🚀 Testing

### Step 1: Register
```
Full Name: John Smith
Email: john.smith@university.edu
Phone: 5550123456
Username: johnsmith (this field is collected but not used)
Password: Test@1234
Confirm Password: Test@1234
Role: STUDENT
Department: Computer Science
✅ Terms & Conditions
```

### Step 2: Logout
Click the logout button from the dashboard

### Step 3: Login (CORRECT WAY)
```
Email: john.smith@university.edu  ← Use EMAIL, not username!
Password: Test@1234
```

### Expected Result:
- ✅ Login successful
- ✅ Redirected to Student Dashboard
- ✅ JWT token stored

## 🔧 Future Improvements

### Option 1: Remove Unused Fields from Registration
Remove `username`, `phone`, and `department` fields from the registration form since backend doesn't support them.

### Option 2: Add Backend Support for These Fields
Extend the backend to support:
- Add `username`, `phone`, `department` columns to User table
- Update RegisterRequest DTO to accept these fields
- Allow login with either email OR username

### Option 3: Use Email as Display Name
Since username isn't stored, could show the email or name in the UI where username would typically appear.

## 📋 Summary

| Field | Registration Form | Backend Storage | Login Support |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Email** | ✅ Collected | ✅ Stored | ✅ Used for login |
| **Username** | ✅ Collected | ❌ Not stored | ❌ Cannot login with it |
| **Phone** | ✅ Collected | ❌ Not stored | ❌ N/A |
| **Department** | ✅ Collected | ❌ Not stored | ❌ N/A |
| **Name** | ✅ Collected | ✅ Stored | ❌ Cannot login with it |
| **Password** | ✅ Collected | ✅ Stored (hashed) | ✅ Required |
| **Role** | ✅ Collected | ✅ Stored | ❌ N/A |

## ✅ Status: FIXED

Users are now clearly informed to login with their **EMAIL** address, not username.
