# 🚀 Event Registration Quick Reference

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Registration Button Not Working ✅ FIXED
**Before:** Clicking "Register" showed "not implemented yet" message  
**After:** Students can successfully register for approved events

### Issue 2: Unapproved Events Showing ✅ FIXED
**Before:** "Tech talk for web devs" was visible even though not approved  
**After:** Only admin-approved events show in student dashboard

### Issue 3: No Admin Approval System ✅ FIXED
**Before:** No way to approve/reject events  
**After:** Admins can approve/reject events via API and UI

---

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Verify Unapproved Events Hidden
```
1. Login as: student1@campus.com / test123
2. Navigate to: Browse Events
3. Expected: Should see "Valid Event" only
4. Expected: Should NOT see "Tech talk for web devs" (it's pending)
✅ PASS: Only approved events visible
```

### Test 2: Event Registration
```
1. Login as: student1@campus.com / test123
2. Click on: "Valid Event"
3. Click: "Register" button
4. Click: "Yes" on confirmation dialog
5. Expected: Success message appears
6. Navigate to: "My Registrations"
7. Expected: Event appears in list
✅ PASS: Registration working
```

### Test 3: Duplicate Registration Prevention
```
1. Try to register for same event again
2. Expected: "Already Registered" message
✅ PASS: Duplicate prevention working
```

### Test 4: Admin Approval (Terminal Test)
```bash
# Approve the pending event
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/admin/events/7/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>"

# Then login as student and check
# Expected: "Tech talk for web devs" now visible
```

## 📊 Database Changes

```sql
-- Events now have status field
SELECT id, title, status FROM events;

-- 3  | Valid Event            | approved
-- 7  | Tech talk for web devs | pending

-- New registrations table
SELECT * FROM event_registrations;
-- Stores student registrations
```
