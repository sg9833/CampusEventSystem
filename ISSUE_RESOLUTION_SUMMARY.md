---

## ✅ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅

#### Added Status Field to Events
```sql
ALTER TABLE events 
ADD COLUMN status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending';

-- Possible values: 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
```

#### Created Event Registrations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_registrations (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    event_id INT NOT NULL,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    registered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_registration (event_id, user_id)
);
```

### 2. Backend Implementation ✅

#### New Models
- ✅ `EventRegistration.java` - Model for event registrations
- ✅ Updated `Event.java` - Added status field

#### New DAOs
- ✅ `EventRegistrationDao.java` - CRUD operations for registrations
- ✅ Updated `EventDao.java` - Added status support and findApproved()

#### New Controllers & Endpoints
- ✅ Updated `EventController.java` - Added 5 new endpoints
- ✅ Created `AdminController.java` - Added 3 admin endpoints

**New Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/events/{id}/register          - Register for event
DELETE /api/events/{id}/register          - Unregister from event
GET    /api/events/registered             - Get user's registrations
GET    /api/events/{id}/registrations     - Get event's registrations (organizer/admin)
GET    /api/events                         - Modified to filter by role

PUT    /api/admin/events/{id}/approve     - Approve event
PUT    /api/admin/events/{id}/reject      - Reject event
GET    /api/admin/events/pending          - Get pending events
```

### 3. Frontend Updates ✅

#### Updated `student_dashboard.py`
```python
def _register_event(self, event):
    """Complete implementation of event registration"""
    - ✅ Validation checks
    - ✅ Duplicate registration prevention
    - ✅ Confirmation dialog
    - ✅ API call to POST /api/events/{id}/register
    - ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
    - ✅ Auto-refresh after successful registration
```

### 4. Access Control ✅

#### Event Visibility by Role
- **Students:** Only see events with status='approved'
- **Organizers:** See all events (to manage their own)
- **Admins:** See all events (to approve/reject)

#### Registration Permissions
- ✅ All authenticated users can register for approved events
- ✅ Users cannot register twice for same event
- ✅ Users cannot register for non-approved events
- ✅ Organizers can view registrations for their events
- ✅ Admins can view all registrations

## 🧪 VERIFICATION

### Current Database State
```
Events:
  ID  | Title                   | Status   | Organizer
  ----+-------------------------+----------+-----------
  3   | Valid Event             | approved | 8
  7   | Tech talk for web devs  | pending  | 2

Event Registrations:
  Currently empty (ready to receive registrations)
```

### System Status
```
✅ Backend: Running on port 8080
✅ Database: Schema updated successfully
✅ Frontend: Registration function implemented
✅ Migration: Completed without errors
```

### Test Results
```
✅ TEST 1: Unapproved events hidden from students
